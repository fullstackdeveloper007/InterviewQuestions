# Latest Version of .net and whats new being added in it

## ⚙️ **Major Updates in .NET 9 + C# 13**

### 🧠 **C# 13 Highlights**

* **`params` for collections** → works with `List<T>`, `Span<T>`, etc., not just arrays.
* **New `lock` type** → improved performance and safer multithreading.
* **Partial properties & indexers** → split property logic across partial classes.
* **`ref struct` can implement interfaces** → better for high-performance, Span-based types.
* **Escape sequence `\e`** → adds ESC character literal.
* **`ref` locals/unsafe in async/iterators** → now allowed for advanced performance code.

### 🚀 **.NET 9 Platform Highlights**

* **Faster runtime & GC** → smarter memory management (DATAS GC) and better CPU optimizations.
* **AI & Tensor support** → new APIs (`Tensor<T>`, `VectorPrimitives`) for AI, ML, and numeric computing.
* **Improved `System.Text.Json`** → more flexible serialization and schema support.
* **Cloud-native focus** → better observability (OpenTelemetry), container performance, and logging.
* **ASP.NET Core** → faster startup, slimmer builds, and improved minimal API patterns.
* **Tooling upgrades** → better build performance, SDK workload management, and diagnostics.
