Desin patterns can be categorized as below:

**Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

**Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
