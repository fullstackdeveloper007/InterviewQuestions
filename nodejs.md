## Node.js

It is a javascript runtime environment by which we can execute javascript code on server and it can be used to build webserver command line interface and web application backend.

Node is build on javascript Chrome V8 engine. node will compile over javascript code to machine readable format. It is build using C++.
Node does not know how to run javascript code. It passed the js code to V8 engine and get the result back.
